This project focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to address risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector. The objective is to analyze loan application data to identify patterns that help distinguish between applicants likely to default and those capable of repayment. The analysis aims to reduce financial losses by minimizing loan approvals for high-risk applicants and ensuring viable applicants are not rejected, thus maximizing business opportunities. The dataset includes various loan application scenarios, such as approved, cancelled, refused, and unused offers, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and loan decision outcomes.
